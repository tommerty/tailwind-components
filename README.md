# Tailwind Components for any site
Feel free to copy/paste these onto any site you're working on. 
You can refer to the [preview site](https://tommerty.github.io/tailwind-components) for references on how they should look.

These should be simple to add to your site, assuming you've set up Tailwind on your site already. If not, I recommend playing around with it via the CDN before getting started by adding `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>` to your `<head>` section on your page.

These do not require any additional extensions or plugins such as Flowbite or DaisyUI.
